<p style="font-size:20px; font-family:Tahoma;"> Narendra Damodardas Modi born 17 September 1950 is an Indian politician serving as the 14th and current prime minister of India since 2014. He was the chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament for Varanasi. Modi is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its National Democratic Alliance (NDA). He is also a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer organisation. He is the first prime minister born after India's independence in 1947, the second non-Congress one to win two consecutive terms after Atal Bihari Vajpayee and the first from outside the Congress to win both terms with a majority in the Lok Sabha.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px; font-family:Tahoma;">Narendra Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a Gujarati Hindu family of grocers in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat). He was the third of six children born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi (c. 1915–1989) and Hiraben Modi (born c. 1920). Modi's family belonged to the Modh-Ghanchi-Teli (oil-presser) community, which is categorised as an Other Backward Class by the Indian government. He was falsely accused by Mayawati that he added his caste to the Other Backward Class (OBC) list as a political tool.
As a child, Modi is said to have helped his father sell tea at the Vadnagar railway station, and said that he later ran a tea stall with his brother near a bus terminus. Narendra Modi completed his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967.In 1978 Modi received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the School of Open Learning at the University of Delhi, graduating with a third class. Five years later, in 1983, he received a Master of Arts degree in political science from Gujarat University, graduating with a first class as an external distance learning student.

<img class="img3" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/svDse00geXQ/hqdefault.jpg" alt="modi3" width="400" height="300">
<p style="font-size:20px; font-family:Tahoma;">Narendra Modi took oath for the fourth consecutive time as Chief Minister of Gujarat, along with seven Cabinet ministers and nine Ministers of State (MoS).
Governor Kamla Beniwal administered the oath of office and secrecy at a glittering, star-studded ceremony at Sardar Patel Stadium here to Modi and his ministerial colleagues amid slogans by thousands of BJP workers.The Cabinet ministers, in the order they took oath are Nitin Patel, Anandiben Patel, Ramanlal Vora, Bhupendrasinh Chudasma, Saurabh Patel, Ganpat Vasava and Babubhai Bokhiria. The MoS are Purushottam Solanki, Parbat Patel, Mrs Vasuben Trivedi, Pradeepsinh Jadeja, Leeladhar Vaghela, Rajnikant Patel, Govind Patel, Nanubhai Vanani and Jayantibhai Kawadia.
Saurabh Patel has been promoted to the Cabinet rank while Vasava, Speaker in the outgoing Assembly, has been inducted into the Council.
Among those present on the occasion were Chief Ministers Shivraj Singh Chouhan (MP), Raman Singh (Chhattisgarh), J. Jayalalithaa (Tamil Nadu) and Parkash Singh Badal (Punjab). Raj and Uddhav Thackeray, leading the two Shiv Senas in neighbouring Maharashtra, BJP leaders LK Advani, Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj, BJP chief Nitin Gadkari and INLD chief Om Prakash Chautala, besides RPI leader Ramdas Athavale, were also present.
Modi’s family members, including his mother Heeraben, were present.
Bihar Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi was absent but the State’s BJP chief C P Thakur was present. No leader from the Janata Dal (United), BJP’s partner in NDA, or its Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, attended the function.
The BJP Government, whose seven ministers lost their seats in a rather pyrrhic victory in the Assembly elections, including technocrat-spokesman Jaynarayan Vyas, has two challenging tasks to handle now: the upcoming Vibrant Gujarat Global Investors’ Summit in January and the 2013-14 Budget, scheduled for March next year. </p>

<h1 style="color:black; text-align:center; font-family:Lucida Handwriting;"> Prime  Minister  Of  India </h1>
<p style="font-size:20px; font-family:Tahoma;">After a vigorous campaign—in which Modi portrayed himself as a pragmatic candidate who could turn around India’s underperforming economy—he and the party were victorious, with the BJP winning a clear majority of seats in the chamber. Modi was sworn in as prime minister on May 26, 2014. Soon after he took office, his government embarked on several reforms, including campaigns to improve India’s transportation infrastructure and to liberalize rules on direct foreign investment in the country.<img class="img4" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Shri_Narendra_Modi_sworn_in_as_Prime_Minister.jpg/800px-Shri_Narendra_Modi_sworn_in_as_Prime_Minister.jpg" alt="modi4" width="300" height="200"> Modi scored two significant diplomatic achievements early in his term. In mid-September he hosted a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping, the first time a Chinese leader had been to India in eight years. At the end of that month, having been granted a U.S. visa, Modi made a highly successful visit to New York City, which included a meeting with U.S. Pres. Barack Obama.
As prime minister, Modi oversaw a promotion of Hindu culture and the implementation of economic reforms. The government undertook measures that would broadly appeal to Hindus, such as its attempt to ban the sale of cows for slaughter. The economic reforms were sweeping, introducing structural changes—and temporary disruptions—that could be felt nationwide. Among the most far-reaching was the demonetization and replacement of 500- and 1,000-rupee banknotes with only a few hours’ notice. The purpose was to stop “black money”—cash used for illicit activities—by making it difficult to exchange large sums of cash. The following year the government centralized the consumption tax system by introducing the Goods and Services Tax (GST), which superseded a confusing system of local consumption taxes and eliminated the problem of cascading tax. GDP growth slowed from these changes, though growth had already been high (8.2 percent in 2015), and the reforms succeeded in expanding the government’s tax base. Still, rising costs of living and increasing unemployment disappointed many as grandiose promises of economic growth remained unfulfilled.
<img class="img5" src="https://cdn.britannica.com/s:690x388,c:crop/14/181314-050-DA2D3B73/Narendra-Modi-Bharatiya-Janata-Party-India-general-2014.jpg" alt="modi5" width="300" height="200">This disappointment registered with voters during the elections in five states in late 2018. The BJP lost in all five states, including the BJP strongholds of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Chhattisgarh. The rival Indian National Congress (Congress Party) won more state assembly seats than the BJP in all five elections. Many observers believed that this portended bad news for Modi and the BJP in the national elections set for the spring of 2019, but others believed that Modi’s charisma would excite the voters. Moreover, a security crisis in Jammu and Kashmir in February 2019, which escalated tensions with Pakistan to the highest point in decades, boosted Modi’s image just months before the election. With the BJP dominating the airwaves during the campaign—in contrast to the lacklustre campaign of Rahul Gandhi and Congress—the BJP was returned to power, and Modi became India’s first prime minister outside of the Congress Party to be reelected after a full term.
In his second term Modi’s government revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, stripping it of autonomy in October 2019 and bringing it under the direct control of the union government. The move came under intense criticism and faced challenges in court, not only for the questionable legality of depriving Jammu and Kashmir’s residents of self-determination but also because the government severely restricted communications and movement within the region. In March 2020, meanwhile, Modi took decisive action to combat the outbreak of COVID-19 in India, swiftly implementing strict nationwide restrictions to mitigate the spread while the country’s biotechnology firms became key players in the race to develop and deliver vaccines worldwide. As part of the effort to counter the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Modi undertook executive action in June to liberalize the agricultural sector, a move which was codified into law in September. Many feared that the reforms would make farmers vulnerable to exploitation, however, and protesters took the streets in opposition to the new laws. Massive protests were organized in Delhi beginning in November and continued into 2021.
